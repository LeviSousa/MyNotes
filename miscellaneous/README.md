## JAMstack

"JAMstack" stands for **J**avascript, **A**PI and **M**arkup. It is a web development architecture, with core principles being *pre-rendering* and *decoupling*.

From the official website:

> Jamstack is the new standard architecture for the web. Using Git workflows and modern build tools, pre-rendered content is served to a CDN and made dynamic through APIs and serverless functions.

"Pre-rendering" means that the website is prebuilt and served directly through a CDN, optimizing static pages and assets.
